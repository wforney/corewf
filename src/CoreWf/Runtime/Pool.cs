    // friendly.  To use this pool, subclass it with a concrete type and
    // override the CreateNew method.  Typically, the type of T will
    // have a default ctor and will use an Initialize(...) method in order
    // to configure it for use.
    // NOTE: CreateNew is required because T : new() requires that the default
    // ctor is public.  We did not want to put public ctors on some of our
    // pooled resources (like NativeActivityContext).
